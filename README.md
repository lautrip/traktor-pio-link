### 3. Configure Traktor
- **MIDI Mapping — In Traktor:**
  `Settings > Controller Manager > Add... > Import TSI` -> select the `.tsi` file from Step 2. Then select for midi in and out your mixer (S9,S7,S11). You only need this to activated pad modes.

  `Settings > Controller Manager > Add... > Pre Mapped > Traktor Kontrol > D2`

### 4. Connect to Mixer
- Ensure your Pioneer mixer is connected via USB.
- In the app, select the mixer from the **MIXER** dropdown.

When Traktor is playing, the **MASTER BPM** display will light up and your mixer's effects will sync perfectly. **You're all set!**
